/**
 * Class Cryptography
 *
 * Class QCryptography: Helps in encrypting and decrypting data using block ciphers.
 *
 * Uses the openssl_* methods
 *
 * Can use a variety of encryption methods, but the default method, AES-256-CBC, is recommended.
 *
 * When using a CBC method, an initialization vector("IV") must be generated and saved. Note that this should NOT use a static value,
 * as it will defeat the purpose of the IV. It must be random. This class will automatically generate a random IV
 * for you, but you must be aware of how this IV is saved. There are two ways to do it:
 *
 * 1) Serialize the instance of this class and save it after you initialize it. You must be sure to save it in a safe place since it
 *      contains your encryption key. For example, you can make it a form variable, or a session variable,
 *      making sure your form or session data is secure and
 *    cannot be seen by a user, then when the instance gets unserialized, the IV will be restored automatically.
 *      Storing the instance in the Application object or a global variable will not work, since these things are reinitialized every
 *    time PHP starts up, and you will get a different IV at that time. If you do not correctly
 *      restore the IV that was used to Encrypt, then you will not be able to Decrypt.
 *
 * 2) Pass a value to $strIvHashKey in the constructor, and the initialization vector will be appended to the resulting encrypted data.
 *    This hash key SHOULD be a static value that is part of your app and must be passed to the constructor of any instance of
 *      Cryptography that will be used to decrypt the data. This gives you the ability to decrypt the value without needing to save
 *      the IV or rely on serialized instance of this class.
 *
 *      Note that the IvHashKey is not the Iv, but rather a hash key used to determine whether the Iv has been tampered with.
 *
 *      Note that appending the IV to the encrypted data does not compromise the encrypted data at all, but it will make the data
 *      larger. If you are doing block-level ciphering and you want the resulting encryption to be the same size as the given data,
 *      you must be aware of that.
